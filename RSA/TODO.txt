KNOWN BUGS to FIX
*chiphered file is 1 byte longer than normal
	although in debugger the value of output's length is 256 the file stubornly has 257 bytes

*chiphered file is not checked properly for length then or something


*public key can't be read by openssl and for the aforementioned reason chiphertext can not be 
decrypted by openssl although the key seems to be proper even by openssl standards
